    <h3>About the Projects</h3>
    <p class="projectbox">These projects were either completed during my tenure at Illinois State University or were personal projects that I have completed using the knowledge that I had gained through my tuition. The games are as follows LINKS
      TBD:<br>
      TRACHYON: Trachyon was a project that was developed for CTK 353. It is a top down shooter is the style of Space Invaders with a survival aspect.<br>
      Excavation: Excavation was a 3D resource obtaining game developed for CTK 353. The game features an AI goblin that tracks the player based on the amount of noise they are making.<br>
      Tower of Terror: This was a level I created for the game Portal 2 as a show of proficiency in CTK 352. The level featured the climb of a tower to reach the end goal.<br>
      Fantasia: Fantasia was a UI-based game that I developed for CTK 354. The game features a "keyword" mechanic where the player must type certain phrases to progress through the world and defeat enemies.</p>
